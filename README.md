The experiment.py is the place for the final version of the stimuli presentation. It needs a settings file generated by `scripts\generate_settings.py` file.

## Setup
Tested in Python 3.8 on windows. Need tkinter to work, otherwise straightforward. The devcontainers do not work due to graphical interface not being passed through and me not able to figure it out :)

There is a problem with the pixid2 library, which probably needs the https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/ drivers to work.

## Test folder
Test folder includes various testing scripts to isolate connection paradigms or individual presentation schemes. Stimuli folder includes sound or picture stimuli for the experiment.
